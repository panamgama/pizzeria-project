# pizzeria-project
This repo contains the SQL scripts for a portfolio project, where the objective was to build a dashboard for a fictitious pizzeria.

Built a data model, SQL Server database, and Power Bi dashboard to track and display key operating metrics of the Pizzeria. Processors such as orders undertaken, inventory usage, and staff rotations were captured in the system design.

A [separate Medium article](https://medium.com/@panamgama/developing-a-dashboard-with-sql-server-power-bi-8cb61fda9b7b) has been written to explain the project in detail.
